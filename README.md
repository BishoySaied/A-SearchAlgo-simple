# A-SearchAlgo-simple
A simple approach to implement A* search algorith is used:
Heuristic function is defined as the Euclidean distance between 2 nodes.
The main interface is:
PathPlanner(Map, Start_Node, Goal_Node)
reurn value: list containing the node numbers constructing the path from start node towards goal (including start and end nodes).
